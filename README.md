# Human-to-Robot Motion
This project focuses on simulating a robotic arm's movement based on human arm motion tracked by a camera. MediaPipe detects motion and sends joint data to a MATLAB/SIMULINK model. Inverse Kinematics calculates joint angles, verified by Forward Kinematics. Trajectory Planning and Velocity Control improve movement efficiency, with results showing joint positions, angles, and velocities, along with a visual movement display.
